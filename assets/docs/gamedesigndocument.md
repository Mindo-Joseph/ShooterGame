# Introduction

This is a 35-hour capstone project for Microverse, in this time I learned how to use the Phaser 3 framework, create the story, find the different assets, test the game and meet all the given requirements.

# Story
A mysterious disease has ravaged Kantu, a small town , the people drop dead and after a while come back to life, the undead is what they call them. An army captain must defend his home when these undead come to invade it.
