# Introduction

This is a 35-hour capstone project for Microverse, in this time I learned how to use the Phaser 3 framework, create the story, find the different assets, test the game and meet all the given requirements.

# Story
A mysterious disease has ravaged Kantu, a small town , the people drop dead and after a while come back to life, the undead is what they call them. An army captain must defend his home when these undead come to invade it.


# GamePlay

## Controls 

- Left joystick for movement.

- Right joystick to aim and fire.
  
**If either of these joysticks seem unresponsive refresh the page**

## GameFlow

- The player has 3 lives
- 1 main game scene
- This scene has zombie enemies with guns.
- Intro scene
- End game scene
- When the user loses all 3 lives is redirected to the Game Over scene
- In the leaderboard scene the 5 best scores are displayed

## Score

- Each enemy kill awards the user 3 points
