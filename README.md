## About The Project
This is a shooter game implemented using Phaser 3. The requirements were as follows

- You must implement a turn-based RPG game with **Phaser** library
- You must implement a **scoring system**, so that when the user completes a game they are given a score (number)
    - You should [use this service API](https://www.notion.so/microverse/Leaderboard-API-service-24c0c3c116974ac49488d4eb0267ade3) to save the score associated to the game and the user name, and display a leaderboard (as a Phaser scene)
- The game must be deployed to a server so that it was accessible online
